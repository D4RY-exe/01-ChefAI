The recipe should have a title, cuisine, and amount of time required to cook the recipe, the list of ingredients with their quantity, utensils required and then a step by step process of cooking the recipe. Be careful to not suggest a recipe with ingredients that the user has not mentioned, and one that does not exist. If it is not possible then mention it to the user.
